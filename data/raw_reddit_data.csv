**0-60times LR vs Plaid**

 On tesla.com the 0-60 times are given as 3.1s for the LR and 1.99s for Plaid. *However* when you look at the fine print (and that only shows when clicking on feature details) you see that Tesla has ""With first foot of rollout subtracted"" but *only* for the Plaid making this an apples to oranges comparison.

If you were to also subtract rollout from the LR times the two numbers would actually be much closer, so Tesla is intentionally making the performance gap seem bigger than it is.

**The screen tilt**

Tesla advertises on the Model S pages that the center screen tilts but now it has come to light that this is something that is not available right now and supposedly comes in a software update. You cannot actually move the screen even manually. There was no mention anywhere that this feature will come later. 

And by knowing Tesla's timelines this might as well be 2 years away.

Elon has tweeted a lot about how the car shifts itself and many news outlets reported on how you don't have to shift manually anymore. Now we know the car can only shift out of park by itself and this is also a **beta** feature, which is arguably one of Tesla's tricks to not have to claim liability.

You still have to shift gears to do 3 way turns or to park, using the onscreen shifter.

**The gaming capabilities**

The product page of the Model S shows the Witcher 3 and the event they demoed Cyberpunk. None of these games are in the car and there is no communication if or when they will be available.

The Product page also shows a game loaded on the rear screen. It is not possible to start games on the rear screen as of now.

**The Plaid+ cancelation**

""Plaid+ was canceled because Plaid is too good"", ""No one needs more than 400 miles"".

Both of these statements are quite dubious and it is clear that Tesla is hiding *something* here, maybe not enough orders or maybe problems with manufacturing the new cells.

I am a Tesla owner and generally very happy and still think that Tesla is the best EV manufacturer but I must say that I become increasingly frustrated with the stuff coming out of Elon's mouth because at this point I just have to stop believing everything he says.","['‚ÄúNo one needs more than 400 miles‚Äù is looking real awkward next to the [roadster specs](https://i.imgur.com/yN6SGOg.jpg)', 'Tesla owner here.  I purchased autopilot and was up sold to FSD because it was months away.  The car would drive from LA to NYC hands free soon after.  This was the end 2016/early 2017\n\nI‚Äôve learned that you are buying what you have.  Don‚Äôt assume anything is coming. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt buy FSD for my next Tesla and told all my referrals to save their money.', 'Does anyone have the 0-60 times that are apples to apples?

For once, I‚Äôd like Tesla to announce something when it‚Äôs actually ready instead of teasing things before hand. And I mean, ready to ship ready. Not ‚Äútwo more weeks to tweak things‚Äù ready. \n\nModel 3 and Y are already selling well and it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre in a crunch to announce and sell S/X/Cybertruck quickly. Just take your time, get everything ready, then announce it to the world. \n\nMore than 10 teraflops of gaming power, a ready to ship Tesla product announced at an event would blow my mind.', 'I actually think that Plaid+ was primarily announced to shit on Lucid‚Äôs Air announcement where they were advertising their 500 mile range. Tesla was able to announce this nonexistent product with a future release date that would have an even better range than the Air and basically smother the press coverage of Lucid‚Äôs achievement. Then they went and canceled it after they already got a ton of press coverage about the 520mile range and I‚Äôve seen a lot of writers mix up the Plaid+ and Plaid ranges when writing about the cars.\n\nThat said, regarding shifting into park. If you stop the car and it‚Äôs on auto brake hold and you open the driver side door the car will automatically park anyways. Not the safest thing since you could accidentally hit the accelerator if you‚Äôre turning and reaching for stuff elsewhere in the car but still, it sort of fulfills this claim.']"

Tesla announces full autonomy hardware (AP 2.0) on all production vehicles starting now [Official Thread - Please keep all posts in here],7674,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/58dprx/tesla_announces_full_autonomy_hardware_ap_20_on/,2226,1476921684,"**All Tesla Vehicles Being Produced Now Have Full Self-Driving Hardware**
 
Self-driving vehicles will play a crucial role in improving transportation safety and accelerating the world‚Äôs transition to a sustainable future. Full autonomy will enable a Tesla to be substantially safer than a human driver, lower the financial cost of transportation for those who own a car and provide low-cost on-demand mobility for those who do not.
 
We are excited to announce that, as of today, all Tesla vehicles produced in our factory ‚Äì including Model 3 ‚Äì will have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver. Eight surround cameras provide 360 degree visibility around the car at up to 250 meters of range. Twelve updated ultrasonic sensors complement this vision, allowing for detection of both hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the prior system. A forward-facing radar with enhanced processing provides additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength, capable of seeing through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead. 

To make sense of all of this data, a new onboard computer with more than 40 times the computing power of the previous generation runs the new Tesla-developed neural net for vision, sonar and radar processing software. Together, this system provides a view of the world that a driver alone cannot access, seeing in every direction simultaneously and on wavelengths that go far beyond the human senses. 
 
Model S and Model X vehicles with this new hardware are already in production, and customers can purchase one today: https://www.tesla.com/autopilot 
 
Before activating the features enabled by the new hardware, we will further calibrate the system using millions of miles of real-world driving to ensure significant improvements to safety and convenience. While this is occurring, Teslas with new hardware will temporarily lack certain features currently available on Teslas with first-generation Autopilot hardware, including some standard safety features such as automatic emergency breaking, collision warning, lane holding and active cruise control. As these features are robustly validated we will enable them over-the-air, together with a rapidly expanding set of entirely new features. As always, our over-the-air software updates will keep customers at the forefront of technology and continue to make every Tesla, including those equipped with first-generation Autopilot and earlier cars, more capable over time.

"Elon Musk on Twitter - ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured. """,5429,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026872652290379776,1662,1533660535,,"['>Earlier today, I announced that I‚Äôm considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420/share. I wanted to let you know my rationale for this, and why I think this is the best path forward.\n\n\n>First, a final decision has not yet been made, but the reason for doing this is all about creating the environment for Tesla to operate best. As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders. Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term. Finally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.\n\n\n\n>I fundamentally believe that we are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission, and when there are not perverse incentives for people to try to harm what we‚Äôre all trying to achieve.\n\n>This is especially true for a company like Tesla that has a long-term, forward-looking mission. SpaceX is a perfect example: it is far more operationally efficient, and that is largely due to the fact that it is privately held. This is not to say that it will make sense for Tesla to be private over the long-term. In the future, once Tesla enters a phase of slower, more predictable growth, it will likely make sense to return to the public markets.\n\n>Here‚Äôs what I envision being private would mean for all shareholders, including all of our employees.\n\n>First, I would like to structure this so that all shareholders have a choice. Either they can stay investors in a private Tesla or they can be bought out at $420 per share, which is a 20% premium over the stock price following our Q2 earnings call (which had already increased by 16%). My hope is for all shareholders to remain, but if they prefer to be bought out, then this would enable that to happen at a nice premium.\n\n>Second, my intention is for all Tesla employees to remain shareholders of the company, just as is the case at SpaceX. If we were to go private, employees would still be able to periodically sell their shares and exercise their options. This would enable you to still share in the growing value of the company that you have all worked so hard to build over time.\n\n>Third, the intention is not to merge SpaceX and Tesla. They would continue to have separate ownership and governance structures.

Toyota earned 434.2 billion yen -- the equivalent of $3.15 billion based on the average exchange rate for the period of 138 yen to the dollar.\r  \n\r  \nToyota\'s decline stemmed in part from extraordinary factors. The automaker is currently shouldering increased material and electricity costs for its suppliers. Higher materials costs, including such assistance to suppliers, pushed down quarterly operating profit by 450 billion yen ($3.07 billion), which was only partially offset by a 370 billion yen boost from a weak yen.\r  \n\r  \nIt also booked one-time expenses of 96.9 billion yen from shutting down production in Russia.\r  \n\r  \n""The decreased profit in July-September does not equate to a decline in Toyota\'s actual earnings potential,"" said Kota Yuzawa at Goldman Sachs Japan. Toyota came out ahead in terms of operating profit, at the equivalent of $4.08 billion to Tesla\'s $3.69 billion.\r  \n\r  \nStill, Tesla has become one of the most profitable automakers in the world. Though its net profit fell short of Mercedes-Benz\'s in July-September, it outearned both BMW and Volkswagen. Its net profit margin came to 15% for the quarter.\r  \n\r  \nTesla\'s success stems largely from the profitability of each of its cars. The Toyota group sold 2.62 million vehicles in the quarter, 7.6 times as many as Tesla\'s 344,000. But its net profit per vehicle came to around $1,200 -- just one-eighth of Tesla\'s $9,570. Tesla is believed to lead the industry in terms of net profit per vehicle sold, even ahead of players like Mercedes-Benz.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nTesla vehicles at charging stations. (Courtesy of Tesla, Inc.)\r  \nTesla\'s profit per vehicle has grown especially quickly since April-June 2021. Investors have responded favorably to the gains, and the company\'s market capitalization was roughly triple Toyota\'s as of Monday at around $655 trillion.\r  \n\r  \nThe gap is a result of the fundamentally different strategies pursued by the two automakers. Toyota offers a wide range of vehicles from gasoline-powered cars to hybrids, electrics and fuel-cell vehicles, and at a variety of sizes and price points.\r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile, Tesla has focused solely on EVs. The Model Y and Model 3 account for over 90% of its sales, which have nearly doubled in two years despite their relatively high price tags. Even the cheaper Model 3 starts at around $40,000 in the U.S.\r  \n\r  \nConfident in its strong brand appeal, Tesla has not hesitated to raise prices to pass on higher material costs to customers. It also started offering lucrative self-driving software as an add-on option ahead of rival automakers.\r  \n\r  \n""The biggest factor behind Tesla\'s profit growth is sales volume, then prices hikes and a rise in self-driving software sales,"" said Koji Endo at SBI Securities.\r  \n\r  \nTesla has been installing so-called Giga Press casting machines to reduce the steps needed for assembly. In general, the use of such a machine could undercut quality but speed up mass-production. Teslas are also sold directly online in principle, a method that offers higher margins than selling via dealerships.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nToyota\'s bZ4X electric vehicle. (The license plate number has been obscured)\r  \nEVs are becoming widespread much faster than experts had anticipated. Boston Consulting Group in June said the share of EVs in global new car sales would reach 39% in 2030, upgrading the estimate it issued a year earlier by 11 points. The group cited tighter environmental regulations in the U.S. and Europe, lower costs and higher demand in revising the figure.\r  \n\r  \nToyota has set the goal of selling 3.5 million EVs in 2030, but currently the bZ4X is its only mass-produced model. A top Toyota official said at an earnings briefing on Nov. 1 that the automaker is exploring other options for mass-producing EVs, while another betrayed a sense of urgency, saying, ""We cannot lose out in EVs.""\r  \n\r  \nElectric vehicles still face challenges.

I returned my Model Y back to Tesla - Full Story/Details,4807,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/gzzj5h/i_returned_my_model_y_back_to_tesla_full/,706,1591747077,"I have been hesitant to post my experience on this subreddit, but ultimately decided this information should be shared with the community. I have added some more details from another post to help outline the facts.

As the title states I returned my Model Y PUP back to Tesla Monday. This was mainly due to safety concerns and poor customer service. I will try and keep my recap short, but there are several items to cover...

I took delivery Friday June 5th in Kansas City (Delivery Center that was assigned). On my way home to Oklahoma City, about half way, I heard some noise from under the car. I pulled over to find the front aero piece hanging down and not attached. I see that I am a mile from a Casino parking lot (in the middle of nowhere Kansas) and decide to limp it there to evaluate further. That mile I could hear terrible noises coming from the front, but I didn't want to be on the shoulder of the interstate dealing with this, so I slowly made it to that parking lot. I call Tesla Roadside and am given the option to drive it back to Kansas City for service or have it towed. They tell me that the towing option would be covered only if the issue is deemed to be a warranty item. If they find its a warranty item I can work on being reimbursed. At this point I had the car for 48 hours and driven 250 miles. I had not hit anything or gone over any rough terrain. I felt confident that this would be a warranty issue. So, in order to avoid any further damage to the vehicle, I opted for the tow and thought I would get this worked out at the service center.¬†

I had it towed to the Kansas City service center Sunday night. An interesting point to note is that there was miscommunication with the tow truck company, and the tow truck driver was told that Tesla paid for the tow in full, so I wouldn't have to sign anything or pay. I asked the driver a few times to confirm, and figured maybe if they find that it wasn't a warranty issue they add it to my service invoice (my first Tesla and Service Experience).

The next day (Monday) after finding accommodations in Kansas City for the night, I arrived at the service center in the morning to make sure everything was handled. Explained what happened, they apologize profusely and say they will take a look. After letting them work on it for a few hours, I hear nothing, but since I don‚Äôt live in Kansas City and have nothing to do, I decide to wait at the Tesla center. My advisor comes out and says the car is ready to drive, but since they don‚Äôt have parts they have just secured it to be ‚Äúdriveable.‚Äù No estimates on when they can get parts (I expected that) and we would address it as soon as they are available. He then tells me this absolutely is covered under warranty because the bolts were not secured properly and it wasn‚Äôt done right at the factory. So, I am glad to hear this, but seriously concerned by the oversight. My advisor then tells me I am responsible for the $1,100 tow truck bill. I am initially confused because the car could not be driven without causing more damage. I wasn‚Äôt close to any store where I could buy supplies to tape it up, and I don‚Äôt want to be blamed for more damage. They tell me I can contact Tesla corporate myself and plead my case, but not to expect much. Disappointed about this outcome, I decide to leave the store to try and get some answers from corporate. I spend the next hour trying to get through to a real person which shockingly is more difficult than I thought it would be. I was only able to get a hold of someone by using roadside assistance. I tell the situation to the agent and the agent confirms that ‚Äúif the repair was covered under warranty then the tow should be included in that claim‚Äù. So basically this issue is with the service center and not corporate according to them.

So my 3rd trip to the service center starts with them completely agreeing that this is a warranty repair. I then tell him that Tesla customer service on the phone said that if it‚Äôs a warranty repair then the towing should be covered. He agrees, but says management won‚Äôt budge. I say I will need this to be resolved because this is my 3rd trip here and the tow truck driver is calling my phone for payment. After a long back room discussion they tell me Tesla WILL pay for it, they just don‚Äôt know if the Service Department or Roadside Assistance group will be paying it. I also find out the long delays are because all of this is being done by email... They don't have a number to call someone about it. That seems like an impossible way to get anything done in a timely manner, but that what I was told...

At this point I am upset that this has been so difficult and wasted my entire day, and being an out of town customer looks like it will be a nightmare. I was only able to get this far because I stayed in Kansas City an extra night and took off work. I tell them I am returning the car and want to start that process. I think they were shocked and I was told this was the first time any customer had done this (at their location). I loved the car, I love Tesla and still do. I just can‚Äôt deal with this type of stuff in the future. I can update everyone on the return process as it continues. All they had me do Monday was sign a ‚ÄúReturn Declaration‚Äù and hand them the keys.

Haven't heard a word from anyone else at Tesla since yesterday at the store. I just hoping to get some confirmation that my refund is in process.

TL;DR - I bought a Tesla Model Y 2 days ago. A manufacturing defect caused me to be stuck 2 1/2 hours from home. Tesla covered the repair under warranty but refused to pay the $1,100 tow truck bill. With some of the delivery issues, this warranty repair, and the terrible customer service it made me rethink this purchase and I walked away. Still like Tesla, but will wait until things are more ironed out.

Some Clarifications

\- the ""aero piece"" is different than the Model 3, it is a hard plastic cover. Some have commented that its just a fabric. On my car it would drag and flap wildly hitting underneath anytime I went over 30 MPH.

\- My biggest concern was voiding the warranty. I could Uber 20 miles to get some tape or remove it. However, I was unable to get any confirmation from Tesla that if I proceed with taping/removing it that it wouldn't void my warranty.- I didn't really return it due to the failure, it was more from how difficult it was to get a hold of anyone at Tesla and discuss the issue. Living in a state that does not have any Tesla locations made me realize that if I had a problem it might be a difficult thing to resolve.

\- My comment about loving Tesla comes from all the things they are trying to accomplish. The car had very little issues (no more than any other new car I had purchased). I know there are some that are in terrible shape and there is no excuse for that. The car was great, and amazing to drive. They really just lost me on the on going support.¬†

&#x200B;

Edit: Some have asked for proof -  [https://imgur.com/a/LvHqk82](https://imgur.com/a/LvHqk82) \- This is the return document signed. It is not an early build for anyone tracking the VINs. The door listed a production date of May 2020, post factory shutdown.

Edit 2: A picture of the damage and panel -  [https://imgur.com/a/gLoZkms](https://imgur.com/a/gLoZkms)  \- The wind would catch this panel and it would hit the car and drag on the ground. My understanding is that the Model Y has a slightly different part than the older Model 3's that were using a fabric composite.

New Tesla Model S Now the Quickest Production Car in the World -new 100 kWh battery pack: 0-60 in 2.5 secs and 315 miles of range,8291,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4z8ahq/new_tesla_model_s_now_the_quickest_production_car/,1162,1471980638,"please keep all posts related to the announcement in this thread


[**New Tesla Model S Now the Quickest Production Car in the World**](https://www.tesla.com/blog/new-tesla-model-s-now-quickest-production-car-world)
 
The Model S P100D with Ludicrous mode is the third fastest accelerating production car ever produced, with a 0-60 mph time of 2.5* seconds. However, both the LaFerrari and the Porsche 918 Spyder were limited run, million dollar vehicles and cannot be bought new. While those cars are small two seaters with very little luggage space, the pure electric, all-wheel drive Model S P100D has four doors, seats up to 5 adults plus 2 children and has exceptional cargo capacity. 
 
The 100 kWh battery also increases range substantially to an estimated 315 miles on the EPA cycle and 613 km on the EU cycle, making it the first to go beyond 300 miles and the longest range production electric vehicle by far. 
 
The larger battery pack is also available on the Model X, making the world‚Äôs quickest SUV even faster. Model X P100D with Ludicrous mode accelerates to 60 mph in 2.9* seconds and travels up to 289 miles EPA and 542 km EU on a single charge. Model X is also a pure electric SUV and can seat up to seven adults. 
 
Model S and Model X are engineered to be the safest cars on the road and to have the highest ratings from NHTSA. Both have access to the Tesla Supercharger network for the freedom to travel long distance for free. And every Tesla will improve over time with free over the air upgrades.

Tesla customers who have ordered a P90D Ludicrous, but not taken delivery, can upgrade to the 100 kWh pack for $10,000. Existing P90D Ludicrous owners can also upgrade to a 100 kWh pack, but for $20,000, as their used 90 kWh pack will have to be recycled. 

While the P100D Ludicrous is obviously an expensive vehicle, we want to emphasize that every sale helps pay for the smaller and much more affordable Tesla Model 3 that is in development. Without customers willing to buy the expensive Model S and X, we would be unable to fund the smaller, more affordable Model 3 development.

""Did you see that Tesla parked outside? That's my car someday,"" she kept saying to her friends. After we got our drinks, I asked her if she could let someone else take orders for a minute and we could give her a ride in the Tesla. She was speechless, and actually started crying. ""Do you mean it?"" she asked. Sure!

She sat in the passenger's seat and I showed her how the MCU worked. We drove around the parking lot in the shopping mall next door. The whole time, she was so overcome with emotion, she could barely talk. She took pictures the entire time with her phone.

When we got back to the Dunkin, her manager said, ""You made her day."" She said, ""You made my whole week!""

Afterwards, I said to my wife, ""This sort of thing never happened with our Toyota."" :)

The only one I could go to had a 1 month wait time and was about a 1 hour and a half drive away. When I was there I asked why it took so long, they said Tesla is probably the worst manufacturer when it comes to sending parts in a timely manner, they never answered the phone when they called their contacts there, and they would send wrong parts sometimes even. I remember the guy told me that Teslas with broken headlamps were waiting there to be repaired for months.
