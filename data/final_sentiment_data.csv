I feel like Tesla's communication around the Model S Plaid has been extremely dishonest.,7293,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/nzu1zh/i_feel_like_teslas_communication_around_the_model/,1322,1623696944,"I feel like Tesla's communication around the Model S plaid has been extremely dishonest and I want to give some examples.

**0-60times LR vs Plaid**

 On tesla.com the 0-60 times are given as 3.1s for the LR and 1.99s for Plaid. *However* when you look at the fine print (and that only shows when clicking on feature details) you see that Tesla has ""With first foot of rollout subtracted"" but *only* for the Plaid making this an apples to oranges comparison.

If you were to also subtract rollout from the LR times the two numbers would actually be much closer, so Tesla is intentionally making the performance gap seem bigger than it is.

**The screen tilt**

Tesla advertises on the Model S pages that the center screen tilts but now it has come to light that this is something that is not available right now and supposedly comes in a software update. You cannot actually move the screen even manually. There was no mention anywhere that this feature will come later. 

And by knowing Tesla's timelines this might as well be 2 years away.

**""The car shifts by itself""**

Elon has tweeted a lot about how the car shifts itself and many news outlets reported on how you don't have to shift manually anymore. Now we know the car can only shift out of park by itself and this is also a **beta** feature, which is arguably one of Tesla's tricks to not have to claim liability.

You still have to shift gears to do 3 way turns or to park, using the onscreen shifter.

**The gaming capabilities**

The product page of the Model S shows the Witcher 3 and the event they demoed Cyberpunk. None of these games are in the car and there is no communication if or when they will be available.

The Product page also shows a game loaded on the rear screen. It is not possible to start games on the rear screen as of now.

**The Plaid+ cancelation**

""Plaid+ was canceled because Plaid is too good"", ""No one needs more than 400 miles"".

Both of these statements are quite dubious and it is clear that Tesla is hiding *something* here, maybe not enough orders or maybe problems with manufacturing the new cells.

I am a Tesla owner and generally very happy and still think that Tesla is the best EV manufacturer but I must say that I become increasingly frustrated with the stuff coming out of Elon's mouth because at this point I just have to stop believing everything he says.","['‚ÄúNo one needs more than 400 miles‚Äù is looking real awkward next to the [roadster specs](https://i.imgur.com/yN6SGOg.jpg)', 'Tesla owner here.  I purchased autopilot and was up sold to FSD because it was months away.  The car would drive from LA to NYC hands free soon after.  This was the end 2016/early 2017\n\nI‚Äôve learned that you are buying what you have.  Don‚Äôt assume anything is coming. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt buy FSD for my next Tesla and told all my referrals to save their money.', 'Does anyone have the 0-60 times that are apples to apples? Either both have a foot of rollout or neither?', 'Add to this, acoustic noise cancellation is not available yet either. \n\nTruth is, I love Tesla‚Äôs engineering but they constantly overpromise and underdeliver. For once, I‚Äôd like Tesla to announce something when it‚Äôs actually ready instead of teasing things before hand. And I mean, ready to ship ready. Not ‚Äútwo more weeks to tweak things‚Äù ready. \n\nModel 3 and Y are already selling well and it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre in a crunch to announce and sell S/X/Cybertruck quickly. Just take your time, get everything ready, then announce it to the world. \n\nMore than 10 teraflops of gaming power, a ready to ship Tesla product announced at an event would blow my mind.', 'I actually think that Plaid+ was primarily announced to shit on Lucid‚Äôs Air announcement where they were advertising their 500 mile range. Tesla was able to announce this nonexistent product with a future release date that would have an even better range than the Air and basically smother the press coverage of Lucid‚Äôs achievement. Then they went and canceled it after they already got a ton of press coverage about the 520mile range and I‚Äôve seen a lot of writers mix up the Plaid+ and Plaid ranges when writing about the cars.\n\nThat said, regarding shifting into park. If you stop the car and it‚Äôs on auto brake hold and you open the driver side door the car will automatically park anyways.

What really annoys me is why is it such a big deal in the first place. I don't mean that to be insensitive to the victims or their families. It's always very disheartening to hear that people lost their lives in car accidents. But do people not understand how many people die in car accidents every single day in the U.S. alone? And this is just one incident. 

But because it was a Tesla, this one time, it was a big enough deal to make national news for some reason, and all of these unfounded rumors keep spreading without any deep investigation. It just goes to show you how much people have it put for Tesla and EVs in general and how much joy they get from hearing about the potential rare failures they have. These people don't care about the lives lost in these accidents, it's all about pushing an anti-EV ""haha I told you so"" agenda. And it's incredibly ridiculous and annoying. Like somehow people just feel so vindicated knowing they still drive an ICE because 2 people got killed in an accident in a Tesla. 

Tons of misinformation, tons of people who have no idea how a Tesla or Autopilot even works. And people just completely ready to be smug about this incident. So weird. I don't get it.","['It even made international news. The most annoying thing about it is that even after all of the rubbish ""information"" gets cleaned up, people will keep talking about it for ages.

The videos the car provided were crucial to establish blame so we can focus on my wife's recovery and not he said she said BS with insurance.

Meanwhile other companies will hold huge pressers and pay millions for commercials, but still not get the same level of coverage.\n\nIt's bad when something negative happens, because even something rather benign will be overblown. Such as a crash or fire.

Take the doors for example. They are hung by hinges attached to the side posts, and if they are slightly angled differently then the closing force on the door can be too great. This means a light push of the door to close it won't be enough, the door may only halfway latch. The door striker placement also determines seal to body distance, which prevents leaks and wind noise. The deck lid striker placement dictates electric assist closing force and longevity of the latch assembly. Panel to panel flushness decreases wind noise and changes appearance of body lines blending together.\n\nWe really did beat on the cars. If the left rear door was sticking out at the top and the bottom was too close to the side panel, we would open the door, put a knee against the lower door panel, both hands across the top of the window frame, and yank backwards with your body weight.

Tesla announces full autonomy hardware (AP 2.0) on all production vehicles starting now [Official Thread - Please keep all posts in here],7674,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/58dprx/tesla_announces_full_autonomy_hardware_ap_20_on/,2226,1476921684,"**All Tesla Vehicles Being Produced Now Have Full Self-Driving Hardware**
 
Self-driving vehicles will play a crucial role in improving transportation safety and accelerating the world‚Äôs transition to a sustainable future. Full autonomy will enable a Tesla to be substantially safer than a human driver, lower the financial cost of transportation for those who own a car and provide low-cost on-demand mobility for those who do not.
 
We are excited to announce that, as of today, all Tesla vehicles produced in our factory ‚Äì including Model 3 ‚Äì will have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver. Eight surround cameras provide 360 degree visibility around the car at up to 250 meters of range. Twelve updated ultrasonic sensors complement this vision, allowing for detection of both hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the prior system. A forward-facing radar with enhanced processing provides additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength, capable of seeing through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead. 

To make sense of all of this data, a new onboard computer with more than 40 times the computing power of the previous generation runs the new Tesla-developed neural net for vision, sonar and radar processing software. Together, this system provides a view of the world that a driver alone cannot access, seeing in every direction simultaneously and on wavelengths that go far beyond the human senses. 
 
Model S and Model X vehicles with this new hardware are already in production, and customers can purchase one today: https://www.tesla.com/autopilot 
 
Before activating the features enabled by the new hardware, we will further calibrate the system using millions of miles of real-world driving to ensure significant improvements to safety and convenience. While this is occurring, Teslas with new hardware will temporarily lack certain features currently available on Teslas with first-generation Autopilot hardware, including some standard safety features such as automatic emergency breaking, collision warning, lane holding and active cruise control. As these features are robustly validated we will enable them over-the-air, together with a rapidly expanding set of entirely new features. As always, our over-the-air software updates will keep customers at the forefront of technology and continue to make every Tesla, including those equipped with first-generation Autopilot and earlier cars, more capable over time.

"Elon Musk on Twitter - ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured. """,5429,https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026872652290379776,1662,1533660535,,"['>Earlier today, I announced that I‚Äôm considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420/share. I wanted to let you know my rationale for this, and why I think this is the best path forward.\n\n\n>First, a final decision has not yet been made, but the reason for doing this is all about creating the environment for Tesla to operate best. As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders. Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term. Finally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.\n\n\n\n>I fundamentally believe that we are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission, and when there are not perverse incentives for people to try to harm what we‚Äôre all trying to achieve.\n\n>This is especially true for a company like Tesla that has a long-term, forward-looking mission. SpaceX is a perfect example: it is far more operationally efficient, and that is largely due to the fact that it is privately held. This is not to say that it will make sense for Tesla to be private over the long-term. In the future, once Tesla enters a phase of slower, more predictable growth, it will likely make sense to return to the public markets.\n\n>Here‚Äôs what I envision being private would mean for all shareholders, including all of our employees.\n\n>First, I would like to structure this so that all shareholders have a choice. Either they can stay investors in a private Tesla or they can be bought out at $420 per share, which is a 20% premium over the stock price following our Q2 earnings call (which had already increased by 16%). My hope is for all shareholders to remain, but if they prefer to be bought out, then this would enable that to happen at a nice premium.\n\n>Second, my intention is for all Tesla employees to remain shareholders of the company, just as is the case at SpaceX. If we were to go private, employees would still be able to periodically sell their shares and exercise their options. This would enable you to still share in the growing value of the company that you have all worked so hard to build over time.\n\n>Third, the intention is not to merge SpaceX and Tesla. They would continue to have separate ownership and governance structures. However, the structure envisioned for Tesla is similar in many ways to the SpaceX structure: external shareholders and employee shareholders have an opportunity to sell or buy approximately every six months.\n\n>Finally, this has nothing to do with accumulating control for myself. I own about 20% of the company now, and I don‚Äôt envision that being substantially different after any deal is completed.\n\n>Basically, I‚Äôm trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible, and where there is as little change for all of our investors, including all of our employees, as possible.\n\n>This proposal to go private would ultimately be finalized through a vote of our shareholders. If the process ends the way I expect it will, a private Tesla would ultimately be an enormous opportunity for all of us. Either way, the future is very bright and we‚Äôll keep fighting to achieve our mission.\n\n>Thanks, Elon', '$420.69 and you got a deal.', 'TSLA has just been halted', 'That would be a market cap of $72 Billion.

Though its net profit fell short of Mercedes-Benz\'s in July-September, it outearned both BMW and Volkswagen.

The Toyota group sold 2.62 million vehicles in the quarter, 7.6 times as many as Tesla\'s 344,000. But its net profit per vehicle came to around $1,200 -- just one-eighth of Tesla\'s $9,570.

I returned my Model Y back to Tesla - Full Story/Details,4807,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/gzzj5h/i_returned_my_model_y_back_to_tesla_full/,706,1591747077,"I have been hesitant to post my experience on this subreddit, but ultimately decided this information should be shared with the community. I have added some more details from another post to help outline the facts.

As the title states I returned my Model Y PUP back to Tesla Monday. This was mainly due to safety concerns and poor customer service. I will try and keep my recap short, but there are several items to cover...

I took delivery Friday June 5th in Kansas City (Delivery Center that was assigned). On my way home to Oklahoma City, about half way, I heard some noise from under the car. I pulled over to find the front aero piece hanging down and not attached. I see that I am a mile from a Casino parking lot (in the middle of nowhere Kansas) and decide to limp it there to evaluate further. That mile I could hear terrible noises coming from the front, but I didn't want to be on the shoulder of the interstate dealing with this, so I slowly made it to that parking lot. I call Tesla Roadside and am given the option to drive it back to Kansas City for service or have it towed. They tell me that the towing option would be covered only if the issue is deemed to be a warranty item. If they find its a warranty item I can work on being reimbursed. At this point I had the car for 48 hours and driven 250 miles. I had not hit anything or gone over any rough terrain. I felt confident that this would be a warranty issue. So, in order to avoid any further damage to the vehicle, I opted for the tow and thought I would get this worked out at the service center.¬†

I had it towed to the Kansas City service center Sunday night. An interesting point to note is that there was miscommunication with the tow truck company, and the tow truck driver was told that Tesla paid for the tow in full, so I wouldn't have to sign anything or pay. I asked the driver a few times to confirm, and figured maybe if they find that it wasn't a warranty issue they add it to my service invoice (my first Tesla and Service Experience).

The next day (Monday) after finding accommodations in Kansas City for the night, I arrived at the service center in the morning to make sure everything was handled. Explained what happened, they apologize profusely and say they will take a look. After letting them work on it for a few hours, I hear nothing, but since I don‚Äôt live in Kansas City and have nothing to do, I decide to wait at the Tesla center. My advisor comes out and says the car is ready to drive, but since they don‚Äôt have parts they have just secured it to be ‚Äúdriveable.‚Äù No estimates on when they can get parts (I expected that) and we would address it as soon as they are available. He then tells me this absolutely is covered under warranty because the bolts were not secured properly and it wasn‚Äôt done right at the factory. So, I am glad to hear this, but seriously concerned by the oversight. My advisor then tells me I am responsible for the $1,100 tow truck bill. I am initially confused because the car could not be driven without causing more damage. I wasn‚Äôt close to any store where I could buy supplies to tape it up, and I don‚Äôt want to be blamed for more damage. They tell me I can contact Tesla corporate myself and plead my case, but not to expect much. Disappointed about this outcome, I decide to leave the store to try and get some answers from corporate. I spend the next hour trying to get through to a real person which shockingly is more difficult than I thought it would be. I was only able to get a hold of someone by using roadside assistance. I tell the situation to the agent and the agent confirms that ‚Äúif the repair was covered under warranty then the tow should be included in that claim‚Äù. So basically this issue is with the service center and not corporate according to them.

So my 3rd trip to the service center starts with them completely agreeing that this is a warranty repair. I then tell him that Tesla customer service on the phone said that if it‚Äôs a warranty repair then the towing should be covered. He agrees, but says management won‚Äôt budge. I say I will need this to be resolved because this is my 3rd trip here and the tow truck driver is calling my phone for payment. After a long back room discussion they tell me Tesla WILL pay for it, they just don‚Äôt know if the Service Department or Roadside Assistance group will be paying it. I also find out the long delays are because all of this is being done by email... They don't have a number to call someone about it. That seems like an impossible way to get anything done in a timely manner, but that what I was told...

At this point I am upset that this has been so difficult and wasted my entire day, and being an out of town customer looks like it will be a nightmare. I was only able to get this far because I stayed in Kansas City an extra night and took off work. I tell them I am returning the car and want to start that process. I think they were shocked and I was told this was the first time any customer had done this (at their location). I loved the car, I love Tesla and still do. I just can‚Äôt deal with this type of stuff in the future. I can update everyone on the return process as it continues. All they had me do Monday was sign a ‚ÄúReturn Declaration‚Äù and hand them the keys.

Haven't heard a word from anyone else at Tesla since yesterday at the store. I just hoping to get some confirmation that my refund is in process.

TL;DR - I bought a Tesla Model Y 2 days ago. A manufacturing defect caused me to be stuck 2 1/2 hours from home. Tesla covered the repair under warranty but refused to pay the $1,100 tow truck bill. With some of the delivery issues, this warranty repair, and the terrible customer service it made me rethink this purchase and I walked away. Still like Tesla, but will wait until things are more ironed out.

Some Clarifications

\- the ""aero piece"" is different than the Model 3, it is a hard plastic cover. Some have commented that its just a fabric. On my car it would drag and flap wildly hitting underneath anytime I went over 30 MPH.

\- My biggest concern was voiding the warranty. I could Uber 20 miles to get some tape or remove it. However, I was unable to get any confirmation from Tesla that if I proceed with taping/removing it that it wouldn't void my warranty.- I didn't really return it due to the failure, it was more from how difficult it was to get a hold of anyone at Tesla and discuss the issue. Living in a state that does not have any Tesla locations made me realize that if I had a problem it might be a difficult thing to resolve.

\- My comment about loving Tesla comes from all the things they are trying to accomplish. The car had very little issues (no more than any other new car I had purchased). I know there are some that are in terrible shape and there is no excuse for that. The car was great, and amazing to drive. They really just lost me on the on going support.¬†

&#x200B;

Edit: Some have asked for proof -  [https://imgur.com/a/LvHqk82](https://imgur.com/a/LvHqk82) \- This is the return document signed. It is not an early build for anyone tracking the VINs. The door listed a production date of May 2020, post factory shutdown.

Edit 2: A picture of the damage and panel -  [https://imgur.com/a/gLoZkms](https://imgur.com/a/gLoZkms)  \- The wind would catch this panel and it would hit the car and drag on the ground. My understanding is that the Model Y has a slightly different part than the older Model 3's that were using a fabric composite. I was not close to a store to complete my own repair, and no way to get a hold of Tesla and confirm my own temporary repair wouldn't void the warranty. Regardless, I was disappointed this part wasn't secured properly at delivery. I did not hit anything, you can see the front lip and the rest of the underside has not scrapes or damage.

Update 1: Just had a call with a Tesla employee at the Kansas City location. He confirmed that my return is in process and I should expect funds back in 15-20 days. He was very nice and professional, but couldn't offer any more information on if my situation will be reviewed by Customer Service leaders at the company. ","['I hope this ends up on the desk and social media and email  of the VP of Customer Experience  (or whatever title they use). This is the perfect test case for the company to use for massive improvements.  If they want to excel at everything,  they need to excel here perhaps the most.', 'Thank you for sharing.

250 miles i had not hit anything or gone over any rough terrain i felt confident that this would be a warranty issue so in order to avoid any further damage to the vehicle i opted for the tow and thought i would get this worked out at the service centeri had it towed to the kansas city service center sunday night an interesting point to note is that there was miscommunication with the tow truck company and the tow truck driver was told that tesla paid for the tow in full so i wouldnt have to sign anything or pay i asked the driver a few times to confirm and figured maybe if they find that it wasnt a warranty issue they add it to my service invoice my first tesla and service experiencethe next day monday after finding accommodations in kansas city for the night i arrived at the service center in the morning to make sure everything was handled explained what happened they apologize profusely and say they will take a look after letting them work on it for a few hours i hear nothing but since i dont live in kansas city and have nothing to do i decide to wait at the tesla center my advisor comes out and says the car is ready to drive but since they dont have parts they have just secured it to be driveable no estimates on when they can get parts i expected that and we would address it as soon as they are available he then tells me this absolutely is covered under warranty because the bolts were not secured properly and it wasnt done right at the factory so i am glad to hear this but seriously concerned by the oversight my advisor then tells me i am responsible for the 1100 tow truck bill i am initially confused because the car could not be driven without causing more damage i wasnt close to any store where i could buy supplies to tape it up and i dont want to be blamed for more damage they tell me i can contact tesla corporate myself and plead my case but not to expect much disappointed about this outcome i decide to leave the store to try and get some answers from corporate i spend the next hour trying to get through to a real person which shockingly is more difficult than i thought it would be i was only able to get a hold of someone by using roadside assistance i tell the situation to the agent and the agent confirms that if the repair was covered under warranty then the tow should be included in that claim so basically this issue is with the service center and not corporate according to themso my 3rd trip to the service center starts with them completely agreeing that this is a warranty repair i then tell him that tesla customer service on the phone said that if its a warranty repair then the towing should be covered he agrees but says management wont budge i say i will need this to be resolved because this is my 3rd trip here and the tow truck driver is calling my phone for payment after a long back room discussion they tell me tesla will pay for it they just dont know if the service department or roadside assistance group will be paying it i also find out the long delays are because all of this is being done by email they dont have a number to call someone about it that seems like an impossible way to get anything done in a timely manner but that what i was toldat this point i am upset that this has been so difficult and wasted my entire day and being an out of town customer looks like it will be a nightmare i was only able to get this far because i stayed in kansas city an extra night and took off work i tell them i am returning the car and want to start that process i think they were shocked and i was told this was the first time any customer had done this at their location i loved the car i love tesla and still do i just cant deal with this type of stuff in the future i can update everyone on the return process as it continues all they had me do monday was sign a return declaration and hand them the keyshavent heard a word from anyone else at tesla since yesterday at the store i just hoping to get some confirmation that my refund is in processtldr i bought a tesla model y 2 days ago a manufacturing defect caused me to be stuck 2 12 hours from home tesla covered the repair under warranty but refused to pay the 1100 tow truck bill with some of the delivery issues this warranty repair and the terrible customer service it made me rethink this purchase and i walked away still like tesla but will wait until things are more ironed outsome clarifications the aero piece is different than the model 3 it is a hard plastic cover some have commented that its just a fabric on my car it would drag and flap wildly hitting underneath anytime i went over 30 mph my biggest concern was voiding the warranty i could uber 20 miles to get some tape or remove it however i was unable to get any confirmation from tesla that if i proceed with tapingremoving it that it wouldnt void my warranty i didnt really return it due to the failure it was more from how difficult it was to get a hold of anyone at tesla and discuss the issue living in a state that does not have any tesla locations made me realize that if i had a problem it might be a difficult thing to resolve my comment about loving tesla comes from all the things they are trying to accomplish the car had very little issues no more than any other new car i had purchased i know there are some that are in terrible shape and there is no excuse for that the car was great and amazing to drive they really just lost me on the on going supportx200bedit some have asked for proof this is the return document signed it is not an early build for anyone tracking the vins the door listed a production date of may 2020 post factory shutdownedit 2 a picture of the damage and panel the wind would catch this panel and it would hit the car and drag on the ground my understanding is that the model y has a slightly different part than the older model 3s that were using a fabric composite i was not close to a store to complete my own repair and no way to get a hold of tesla and confirm my own temporary repair wouldnt void the warranty regardless i was disappointed this part wasnt secured properly at delivery i did not hit anything you can see the front lip and the rest of the underside has not scrapes or damageupdate 1 just had a call with a tesla employee at the kansas city location he confirmed that my return is in process and i should expect funds back in 1520 days he was very nice and professional but couldnt offer any more information on if my situation will be reviewed by customer service leaders at the company,i returned my model y back to tesla full storydetails,['i hope this ends up on the desk and social media and email of the vp of customer experience or whatever title they use this is the

""And it\'s really I think backfiring on them."" The NLRB will now investigate the claims and could prosecute them before a judge if it finds merit. \n""This is a form of collective retaliation... designed to terrify everyone about potential consequences of them organizing, as well as to attempt to cull the herd,"" Workers United organizer Jaz Brisack told Bloomberg.

New Tesla Model S Now the Quickest Production Car in the World -new 100 kWh battery pack: 0-60 in 2.5 secs and 315 miles of range,8291,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4z8ahq/new_tesla_model_s_now_the_quickest_production_car/,1162,1471980638,"please keep all posts related to the announcement in this thread


[**New Tesla Model S Now the Quickest Production Car in the World**](https://www.tesla.com/blog/new-tesla-model-s-now-quickest-production-car-world)
 
The Model S P100D with Ludicrous mode is the third fastest accelerating production car ever produced, with a 0-60 mph time of 2.5* seconds. However, both the LaFerrari and the Porsche 918 Spyder were limited run, million dollar vehicles and cannot be bought new. While those cars are small two seaters with very little luggage space, the pure electric, all-wheel drive Model S P100D has four doors, seats up to 5 adults plus 2 children and has exceptional cargo capacity. 
 
The 100 kWh battery also increases range substantially to an estimated 315 miles on the EPA cycle and 613 km on the EU cycle, making it the first to go beyond 300 miles and the longest range production electric vehicle by far. 
 
The larger battery pack is also available on the Model X, making the world‚Äôs quickest SUV even faster. Model X P100D with Ludicrous mode accelerates to 60 mph in 2.9* seconds and travels up to 289 miles EPA and 542 km EU on a single charge. Model X is also a pure electric SUV and can seat up to seven adults. 
 
Model S and Model X are engineered to be the safest cars on the road and to have the highest ratings from NHTSA. Both have access to the Tesla Supercharger network for the freedom to travel long distance for free. And every Tesla will improve over time with free over the air upgrades.

Tesla customers who have ordered a P90D Ludicrous, but not taken delivery, can upgrade to the 100 kWh pack for $10,000. Existing P90D Ludicrous owners can also upgrade to a 100 kWh pack, but for $20,000, as their used 90 kWh pack will have to be recycled. 

While the P100D Ludicrous is obviously an expensive vehicle, we want to emphasize that every sale helps pay for the smaller and much more affordable Tesla Model 3 that is in development. Without customers willing to buy the expensive Model S and X, we would be unable to fund the smaller, more affordable Model 3 development.

Young lady actually cried in my Tesla today,7469,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9v46bp/young_lady_actually_cried_in_my_tesla_today/,658,1541630031,"My wife and I stopped by our local Dunkin Donuts this morning for coffee, and while we were there, one of the young women behind the counter was talking to her two co-workers about our Model S parked outside.

""Did you see that Tesla parked outside? That's my car someday,"" she kept saying to her friends. After we got our drinks, I asked her if she could let someone else take orders for a minute and we could give her a ride in the Tesla. She was speechless, and actually started crying. ""Do you mean it?"" she asked. Sure!

She sat in the passenger's seat and I showed her how the MCU worked. We drove around the parking lot in the shopping mall next door. The whole time, she was so overcome with emotion, she could barely talk. She took pictures the entire time with her phone.

When we got back to the Dunkin, her manager said, ""You made her day."" She said, ""You made my whole week!""

Afterwards, I said to my wife, ""This sort of thing never happened with our Toyota."" :)

Even after having our car for a whole year now, this is my favorite part of owning a Tesla: being able to share the experience with others.
